<em>...what's up with the banner at the top of the page, </em>you ask?

It's a blackboard of physics mumbo-jumbo and an inside physics joke or two.

From the left... we have the Schrödinger equation above a coffee cup. The Schrödinger equation describes how very small subatomic things behave. The coffee cup is similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillatorhttp://">quantum harmonic oscillator</a>, in which particles are only able to have specific energies (depicted by the dotted lines). The lowest energy allowed for a particle in a quantum harmonic oscillator is called the <em>ground state</em> (hence the inside joke).

Then we have a coffee bean, radiating "good vibes". The power of these good vibes is described by the Larmor Formula just below it. In real physics, the Larmor Formula gives the power of EM waves radiated from an accelerating, electrically charged particle that's moving slowly.

Further right we have two coffee beans, each in their own reference frame. Each of them is experiencing <em>time dilation</em> and <em>length contraction</em> in agreement with Einstein's <em>Special Relativity</em>.  The equations below the diagrams are the <em>Lorentz Transformations</em> for time and space.

There. We have Quantum Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism and Special Relativity all united on the same blackboard with Caffeine. (If you think I'm going to try to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_theory_of_gravity">throw gravity in here, you must be crazy</a>.)
