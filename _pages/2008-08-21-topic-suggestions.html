I don't know if this is a good idea, but I'm giving you (yes, you!) the opportunity to suggest physics topics for me to blog about. It could be something you heard in the news (eg. quantum teleportation) that you don't understand, and want explained better (hopefully). It could also just be a physics topic of general interest that you think the world -- or at least the subset of it who reads my blog -- would like to know about.

So... comment away!
