I recently attended a lecture given by Lawrence Krauss which he called "Our Miserable Future". It was a very interesting talk, giving an overview of the long term fate of Life, the Universe, and even Cosmology.

Consider this: <a href="http://awellcaffeinatedblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/whats-up-with-this-expanding-universe.html">The universe is expanding</a>, and the farther away a galaxy is from us, the faster it will appear to travel away from us. This means that beyond a certain distance, galaxies will "appear" to travel faster than the speed of light. I should not say "appear", really, because if a galaxy seems to travel faster than the speed of light away from us due to the expansion of the universe, then the light emitted from that galaxy will never be able to reach us. So, in fact, past a certain distance, we won't be able to see any galaxies at all.

Now realize this: In 1998, astrophysicists discovered that the universe is not only expanding, it is an <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9805201">accelerated expansion</a>. This will mean that the galaxies we see today, will eventually "speed up" and appear to travel faster than the speed of light, so we won't be able to see them. Eventually, (well beyond the death of our sun, so don't hold your breath) we won't be able to see any galaxies in the universe. A very lonely thought.

What's worse, the only way we know about universal expansion, is because we can measure other galaxies and see them traveling away from us. So well into the future, astrophysicists will have no proof that their universe is expanding.

Which kind of makes you wonder, eventually one of the amazing observations in physics won't be observable. How many other amazing observations have we already missed by not evolving earlier after the big bang to discover them?
