The <a href="http://hubblesite.org/">Hubble site</a> has created a <a href="http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/dark_energy/">very snazzy new (flash) page that tries to explain dark energy and the expansion of the universe to the layman</a>. It is definitely worth checking out, and has lots of pretty animations.

The beginning is definitely my favorite part. It has the atmosphere of an epic theatrical trailer, hinting on doomsday scenarios. Though, viewer be warned, even the Hubble site is not without fault. Sean Carroll has <a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/2007/12/10/a-dark-misleading-force/">voiced his beefs with the accuracy of their explanations</a> in the wonderful blog <a href="http://www.cosmicvariance.com/">Cosmic Variance</a>. That's not to say they are all wrong, they have just chosen some poor wording on occasion.
