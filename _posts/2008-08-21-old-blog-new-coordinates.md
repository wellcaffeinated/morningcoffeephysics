Hello there, newcomers and faithful fans.

I've finished moving my old blog at blogspot to... well... here! If you don't know what this blog is all about (and can't guess from the title), it's about physics! Physics concepts, random tidbits, interesting events, etc.

<em>...but why coffee</em>, you ask?

I like coffee. I like physics.  Why not somehow unify the two? You can also check the "about this blog" link at the top. I will be fleshing it out in days to come.

I've got a lot of new post ideas, so stay tuned...

Until then... here! Have a <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=1261">physics related comic strip</a>. Or better yet, <a href="http://xkcd.com/465/">have two</a>.
