So far, we don't have much in the way of galactic communication. Broadcasting messages throughout the galaxy would take enormous amounts of energy. This energy usage can be reduced by focusing the message on a certain solar system. But shining laser light or neutrino beams at a specific solar system has the "needle in the haystack" problem; it would only be effective if you knew someone was listening. This is why the paper I found on arXiv is so interesting. It's called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0339"><em>The Cepheid Galactic Internet</em></a>, and the authors put forth an idea for using <em>Cepheid variable stars</em> to broadcast messages that can be picked up by anyone in the galaxy (or maybe further). Now, implementation of this idea is not really within human capability, and probably won't be for millenia. For one thing, we'd have to actually get up close to a Cepheid variable star, which aren't exactly in the neighborhood. Instead the authors suggest that this is a physically possible technique that an advanced civilization might use to try to communicate with beings across a galaxy, without knowing their exact location.

<em>...so what the heck is a Cepheid variable star, you ask? </em>

Well. A Cepheid is a special type of star that continually gets brighter and dimmer over a period of anywhere between one to fifty days, depending on the star. These oscillations happen at regular intervals and, amazingly, there is a correlation between the period of the Cepheid, and how intrinsically bright it is. Because of this, Cepheids are frequently used to measure distances. By looking at the Cepheid's period of oscillation we can tell how intrinsically bright it is, and when we compare that to how bright it looks to us, we can determine how far away it is. An analogy would be putting a 60W light bulb at some distance and measuring how bright it appears to you. You know it's 60W, so you know its intrinsic brightness. Comparing that with how bright it looks to you will tell you how far away it is. The dimmer it looks to you, the farther away from you it must be.

<em>... so how can you encode messages in it?</em>

I'm glad you asked, but in order to understand that, you first have to understand a little about how a Cepheid variable oscillates. Cepheids are special in that they burn their fuel at a temperature high enough to ionize Helium (He<sup>+</sup>) which is already present in their atmosphere a second time to become He<sup>++</sup>. Cepheids have an atmosphere that contains Helium which has already been ionized. As they burn their fuel, Cepheids heat up the He<sup>+</sup> in their atmosphere enough to give the outermost helium electron enough energy to escape. When an electron escapes from an He+ atom you are left with He<sup>++</sup>. As it turns out, He<sup>++</sup> is not as transparent as He<sup>+</sup> (physicists say it has a higher <em>opacity</em>). This means that the newly formed He<sup>++</sup> atmosphere does not let the light from the star -- and thus, the energy -- escape as quickly as it could before. All of this energy builds up and creates pressure inside the star. The star then has to expand because of this pressure. As a star expands it cools down (as dictated by basic thermodynamics). As the star cools, theÂ He<sup>++</sup> atmosphere cools and becomes He<sup>+ </sup>again. This means the atmosphere is more transparent, which releases more energy, which lowers the pressure, which shrinks the star, and starts the whole thing over again.

Now, what we have here is a huge pulsating signal that can be seen anywhere in the galaxy and even beyond that. All it says at the moment is: "pulse - pulse - pulse - ...". Suppose you could just control it enough so that you could get it to say something like: "pulsepulse - - pulse - pulse - pulsepulse - ...". You could use that to encode a message in a similar way you'd encode a message in Morse Code! What this comes down to is, controlling the period, just a little bit. This can be done by giving some extra energy to the star to trigger its cycle slightly too early. A nice analogy would be relating the star to a person on a swing set, swinging back and forth. As they swung back, you gave them a push a bit too soon, which slowed them down and caused them to swing forward sooner than had you left them alone. This would change their oscillation period in a similar way as changing the oscillation period of a Cepheid variable by adding extra energy a bit "too soon". In this way, the Cepheid is like a stereo speaker. Alone it doesn't do much for communication purposes (it might just hum a bit). If you connect the speaker to a iPod, the iPod will modulate the current in the speaker, and the speaker will amplify it. The iPod doesn't need to use up much energy to transmit the signal; it just needs enough to control the speaker which uses its own energy (from an electrical socket, or something) to amplify the signal. So the "extra energy" is like the iPod which gets amplified by the Cepheid variable (stereo speaker).

The authors say that the best way to give this extra energy is to send a stream of neutrinos into the star, because neutrinos are the only particles small enough to travel right into the core of the star. Now, we of course have no way of producing a large enough stream of neutrinos to do this, let alone travel lightyears to a Cepheid variable and control its period with them. But hey! Who knows, maybe there's already a civilization that has the capacity to do this. We could find out by looking at the Cepheids' twinkling a bit more closely...
