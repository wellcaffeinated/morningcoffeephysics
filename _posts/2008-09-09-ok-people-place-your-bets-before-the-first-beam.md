Everybody's talking about it...

The LHC is sending its <a href="http://lhc-first-beam.web.cern.ch/lhc-first-beam/Welcome.html">first beam</a> through the coils of supercooled magnets that run through a giant underground tunnel of 27 kilometer circumference. It all happens <em>September 10th (tomorrow)</em>. Physicists and fans around the world will be crossing their fingers hoping for a flawless start up. Although there won't be any collisions today, tomorrow is symbolic of an 8 billion dollar, 11 year excursion that has finally come to an end. Now, the physics starts. If we're lucky, we won't just find what we're looking for... we'll find even more.

The wonderful blog, <a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/2008/09/09/live-blogging-the-lhc-startup/trackback/">Cosmic Variance, is doing a live blog post</a> of the events leading up to the first beam injection. Some of the readers are also placing their bets on what it will find.
