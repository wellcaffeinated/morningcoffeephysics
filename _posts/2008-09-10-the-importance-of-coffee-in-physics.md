I just stumbled across a cute post on the blog "<a href="http://diracseashore.wordpress.com/">Shores of the Dirac Sea</a>" about <a href="http://diracseashore.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/everyday-physics-coffee/trackback/">the importance of coffee in physics</a>.
<blockquote>...the caffeine is always there. What is sure is that physicists drink coffee regularly and that is a fact. Now, being as I am, born from a country where coffee is a main export item, I can be very picky as to how good coffee is supposed to taste. Also as to how it is supposed to be prepared. I can go at length about it. So I thought, how can I talk about coffee and physics at the same time?</blockquote>
It even features a picture of a mad scientist's coffee machine! Check it out!
