Found some really <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/multimedia/hurr_ike091008.html">neat pictures of Hurricane Ike</a>, courtesy of the NASA website. They were taken from the International Space Station on September 10th, 2008. The pictures really show the neat structure and you can even see the shadows that the clouds create over the earth. Amazing.
