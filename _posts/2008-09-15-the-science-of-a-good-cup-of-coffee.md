Just thought I'd point you all to a fantastic <em>Free University of the Airwaves</em> <a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/1361/trackback">podcast that delves into the science and methods behind making a good cup of coffee</a>.

Today I learned that I shouldn't be making coffee with boiling water. Apparently the "optimal" temperature is about 80-90Â°C. Boiling water has a tendency to burn the grounds causing an overly bitter brew. The flavour of the coffee is also very dependant on the grain size and even more so on the way the beans are roasted (but that I expected). Smaller grains, when brewed, have a tendency to get carried away with the water. This means a coffee made with small enough grains will have particles of coffee contained in every sip which give more body to it. I was also surprised to learn that espresso has less caffeine than a regular cup of coffee. It seems that there is no correlation between the darkness of the coffee and the caffeine content.

It's a neat 45 minutes of caffeinated goodness. Check it out!

...now I need a coffee...
