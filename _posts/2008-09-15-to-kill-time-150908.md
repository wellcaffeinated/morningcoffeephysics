<a href="http://www.sciam.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=john-mccain-talks-science-says-hes-2008-09-15">"John McCain talks science, says he's Wi-Fi's main man" from <em>Scientific American</em></a>
<blockquote><em>In a page out of the Al Gore playbook, McCain boasts that "under my guiding hand, Congress developed a wireless spectrum policy that spurred the rapid rise of mobile phones and Wi-Fi technology."</em></blockquote>
<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080915162420.htm">"First Picture Of Likely Planet Around Sun-like Star" from <em>Science Daily</em></a>
<blockquote><em>“This is the first time we have directly seen a planetary mass object in a likely orbit around a star like our Sun,[...] If we confirm that this object is indeed gravitationally tied to the star, it will be a major step forward.”</em></blockquote>
<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article4761132.ece">"Easily caught in a web of sinister untruths" from <em>Times Online</em></a>
<blockquote><em>[...]“evolution” is simply not a worldview, It is, rather, the best scientific hypothesis we have, by miles, for how species develop. By contrast both creationism and its sly relative, intelligent design, are readily falsifiable by scientific method.</em></blockquote>
<a href="http://asymptotia.com/2008/09/15/bubble-magic/trackback/">"Bubble Magic!" from <em>Asymptotia</em></a>
<blockquote><em>Sterling Johnson during his marvellous presentation last night in Categorically Not!: Bubbles at the Santa Monica Art Studios.</em></blockquote>
<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2008/09/reading_online_and_in_college.php">"Reading On-Line and in College" from <em>Uncertain Principles</em></a>
<blockquote><em>In the eye-tracking test, only one in six subjects read Web pages linearly, sentence by sentence. The rest jumped around chasing keywords, bullet points, visuals, and color and typeface variations.</em></blockquote>
<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2008/09/sticky-notes.html">"Sticky Notes" from <em>Backreaction</em></a>
<blockquote><em>Dull office? Here's a suggestion [...]</em></blockquote>
<a href="http://talklikeaphysicist.com/2008/clear-explanation-of-how-lhc-works-and-how-the-protons-get-their-grooves/trackback/">"Clear explanation of how LHC works and how the protons get their grooves" from <em>Talk Like a Physicist</em></a>

<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2008/09/shoot_the_moon.php">"Shoot the Moon" from <em>Built on Facts</em></a>
<blockquote><em>If you were on the moon, which is a vacuum, and tried to shoot a gun, would it fire? After all combustion needs an atmosphere with oxygen... or does the casing of the bullet create its own atmosphere? If so, the bullet would travel farther in the reduced gravity, but would it travel faster than it does on the earth?</em></blockquote>
<a href="http://arxivblog.com/?p=620">"How supermassive black holes help galaxies evolve" from <em>the physics arXiv blog</em></a>
<blockquote><em>[...] what makes Heckman’s discussion highly provocative is the suggestions that a symbiotic relationship exists between galaxies and supermassive black holes, that they need each other to form. So supermassive black holes are as important in galactic evolution as gas, dust and gravity.</em></blockquote>
