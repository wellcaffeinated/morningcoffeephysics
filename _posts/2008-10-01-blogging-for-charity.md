From the relatively few number of readers I seem to have, this post is probably a drop in the ocean. But hey, it's something. If you haven't heard of the DonorsChoose <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/motherboard.html?motherboardId=1">Blogger Challenge</a>, then, well... you have now! Every year DonorsChoose asks bloggers around the net to get their readers to donate towards improving public schools of their choice from a list. This is actually a U.S. effort, but why should that stop me from advertising it?

Besides, I'm not really advertising for my own blog. I'm going to point you all to one of my favorite blogs: <a href="http://cosmicvariance.com">Cosmic Variance</a>. They have <a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/2008/10/01/donorschoose-challenge/trackback/">prepared their own challenge as Sean describes here</a>:
<blockquote><em>It’s a simple and compelling model: individual classrooms isolate a pressing need, and donors can choose which projects to support. We’ve picked out a number of great projects that will help students learn about science in fun, hands-on ways, and we’re going to be adding a few more soon.</em>

<em>We’ve set a fundraising goal of $10,000 over the next month. That sounds like a lot, but it is enormously less than the capacity of our readers; we get about 5,000 hits per day, so that’s a pitiful $2/visitor. But most visitors, we understand, are wimps. So if we get $20/person from the 10% of visitors who are not wimps, we hit the goal. But it’s okay to go over! If we fall short, you should all feel embarrassed.</em></blockquote>
So, go now! Give a few bucks to help improve scientific literacy in the world!
