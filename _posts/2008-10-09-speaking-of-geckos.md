... what's that? Nobody mentioned the word geckos?

Oh.

<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Tokay_foot.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="Gecko foot" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Tokay_foot.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="152" /></a>Well anyway, I just discovered a neat <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/36185">article on Physicsworld</a> describing a new wonder material made of <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/27164"><em>carbon nanotubes</em></a> that mimics the sticky padding on a gecko's foot... the interesting thing is: the imitation is <em>ten times stickier</em>! Carbon nanotubes are exactly what they sound like; they are very thin tubes made of carbon. What you can't tell from the name is that the walls of carbon nanotubes are just a single atom of carbon thick.

Somehow, physicists have been able to coax the nanotubes into a fiberous forest similar to that on the pads of a gecko's fingers. Just like a gecko's fingers, this material interacts with surfaces creating forces between the molecules of the material and the surface (aka: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force">Van der Waals Forces</a>) that resist motion parallel to the surface. If you pull the material away perpendicular to the surface, the nanotubes peel off fairly easily.

Apparently they are trying to (and I quote) "<em>optimize the structure and scale it up so that they can make 'spiderman' gloves</em>".

Could those physicists' research be any cooler?
