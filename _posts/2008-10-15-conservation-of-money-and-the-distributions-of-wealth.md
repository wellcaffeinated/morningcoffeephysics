Of course, I'm going to put a physics spin on this (spin 1/2 to be exact... the other half will be economics).

Bee at <em>Backreaction</em> <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2008/10/this-is-your-economy-on-drugs.html#links">wrote a nice post</a> in which she related capital gain in economies to the reward response in the human brain. In the human brain, ways to cheat the reward circuit can be used, like drugs, which directly stimulate the reward response and as a consequence defeat the original purpose; namely survival. <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2008/10/this-is-your-economy-on-drugs.html#links">She argues</a> that the same is true in economics.
<blockquote><em>One can cheat on these reward mechanisms as well, which leads to the emergence of tactics that run contrary to the original intention of being beneficial for the society. We therefore have means to constrain damaging behavior like proper product information, property rights, ethical codes for scientific conduct, trade laws, or marketplace regulations. Again, the question of what needs attention is a discussion constantly in flux. The aim is in all cases to ensure that the pursuit of individual interests within a given system results in desirable long-term and large-scale trends.</em></blockquote>
We develop regulations to reduce the amount of abuse. But on what are these regulations based? She argues that most of these regulations are developed by a process of trial and error. And experiments are conducted with the well-being of billions of people depending on the results. The scientific revolution has spawned fields of study (such as physics), which give precise and specific predictions of nature, from imprecise fields of study (such as philosophy). Why hasn't the same been done for social sciences? Let's consider the possibility of doing that. Until recently we haven't had the means of dealing with the huge amounts of data needed to track people's trends. We are now beginning to get this kind of data, and in fact, some are beginning to apply scientific methods to social problems.

<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7107"><img class="alignright" title="Distribution of wealth" src="http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/cms/dn7107/dn7107-1_279.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="230" /></a>One such field is called <em>econothermodynamics</em>. It tries to apply methods used in thermodynamics to describe <em>large</em> distributions of people, just as thermodynamics describes macroscopic distributions of particles. A simple model begins with a conservation law, just like in physics. Instead of conservation of energy between particles, it is conservation of money between people. When two people interact, one person will "loose" a certain amount of money to the other person. Obviously on the person-to-person level there are reasons for this money exchange, but if you look at a huge group of people, the money exchange is essentially random, like the random exchange of energy in an ideal gas [1]. The result is a distribution of wealth that looks very much like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution">classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution</a>. When the researchers compare this to real data, they find it fits <a href="http://www2.physics.umd.edu/~yakovenk/papers/income.pdf">remarkably well</a> [2].

Actually this gas model only fits for 97% of the population. The other 3%, are the super rich, who seem to fit another distribution called Pareto's law, which is a power law. Essentially the majority of the wealth distribution is hogged by a minority of the population. To make things worse, one prediction of the gas model distribution of wealth is that it is very resistant to change. The economic state will always want to be in equilibrium (like a gas) and return to the same distribution in which it began [3].

...<em>but people are too complex to model</em>, you say? I disagree. History is filled with people saying that certain things are too hard to model, and yet we've modeled them. The point is not to model individual people, it is to model large groups by simplifying the data and making reasonable assumptions to make it easier to work with.

...<em>but people aren't like particles, they have free thought</em>, you say? I'll agree with that. But that's no reason not to try to model them. Particles aren't like particles! The ideal gas law has its limits even in thermodynamics. The goal of scientific models is not to apply it blindly to every situation. One must know the limits of the model, the sources of error, the assumptions made. Good science is honest about its own limitations. This does not make it less useful, it makes it more useful. ZapperZ at <a href="http://physicsandphysicists.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-economics-will-never-be-like.html"><em>Physics and Physicists</em> illustrates this</a>:
<blockquote><em>It certainly is ironic that fields in "hard" sciences are more concerned about uncertainty and "error bars" in our work and experimental data, while "soft" science such as politics, economics, and social sciences that deal with less-verified principles are presented with such definite certainty.</em></blockquote>
One of the best criticisms of models of people that I've come across is that people are aware of the models describing them. In other words, there is a feedback mechanism to the very act of modeling a social system. <a href="http://media.www.thestute.com/media/storage/paper1092/news/2008/10/10/Opinion/The-Scientific.Curmudgeonwhy.Economics.Will.Never.Be.Like.Physics-3474006.shtml">Some see this as a dead end</a>. I think that's overly pessimistic. It makes it more difficult, surely. But there is a possibility of dealing with such a feedback. If it can't be included in the model there's at least a chance it can be used to put additional limitations on the model.

The scientific method has taken us astoundingly far. One hundred years ago, people would have called you crazy if you said that by measuring little vibrations of electrons in a metal rod, you could hear and see exactly what someone was saying and doing half way around the world (television). Maybe modeling people isn't possible. But throwing up our hands and giving up seems like a very silly attitude. Even a little bit of precision is better than guesswork.
