Posting has been slow this week. I have excuses all lined up for you. Firstly, I was a judge at the <a href="http://cupc.ca/">Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference (CUPC)</a> which was hosted at the University of Toronto last weekend. All in all, it was fun. I listened to many undergrads presenting their research in a cold dark lecture room. Very few showed their fear of public speaking (and who could blame them, really). If that wasn't interesting enough, several prominent physicists were invited to give talks to the massive group of undergraduate students from around the country. My personal favorite was Lawrence Krauss, who gave a very similar talk to one <a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/2007/10/20/a-very-lonely-future/trackback/">I attended (and blogged about) at McGill</a>. This time, however, he prepared it so that an undergrad could fully benefit from the information.

While at the CUPC, much to my surprise, I bumped into a fellow science blogger, Chris Ing of <em><a href="http://www.jacksofscience.com/">Jacks Of Science</a>.</em> I remembered his blog once he mentioned his fantastic post of <a href="http://www.jacksofscience.com/art/bring-love-to-the-lab-with-a-science-valentine/trackback/">science Valentine's Day cards</a>.

Apart from that, I've been learning the <a href="http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=mTg5V2oA_hY">Lindy Hop</a>, and catching up on assignments and sleep. I've also been catching up on my rss feeds. Here are a few things I found that you shouldn't miss:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081022/full/news.2008.1185.html?s=news_rss">X-Rays produced from peeling scotch tape! Seriously. Enough to even take an X-ray photograph.</a> It comes with a great <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/videoarchive/x-rays">video of the researchers</a> too.</li>
	<li>Ever wonder why atheists don't publicize their views like christians do? Well, wonder no longer. They've gone and done it! <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/religion-advertising">Atheist bus adverts</a>.</li>
	<li>You also might find it interesting to read Bee's <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2008/10/ten-steps-to-improve-world.html">Eleven steps to improve the world</a>.</li>
