The <a href="http://www.ugrad.physics.mcgill.ca/~msps/">physics undergraduate students</a> at my old university, McGill (based in Montreal), have exercised their creative talents and come up with a T-shirt design to unite them all. It portrays the great difficulty that every McGill undergrad goes through on their way to completing a B.Sc. in physics. It, of course, does this all with style, sophistication, and whit.

Here it is for your pleasure:

<a href="http://www.ugrad.physics.mcgill.ca/~msps/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=15"><img class="aligncenter" title="McGill Physics; Expect Pain" src="http://www.ugrad.physics.mcgill.ca/~msps/images/tshirt_designs/expectpain.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="275" /></a>

If you don't get the joke here, you're probably not familiar with quantum mechanics. That's okay. Let me try to explain it a bit. The Greek letters (psi) around the frowny face form the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_value_(quantum_mechanics)#Formalism_in_quantum_mechanics"><em>expectation value</em></a> of ... the frowny face (pain). What that is loosely suggesting is that if you asked (measured) a statistically significant number of McGill physics students, the average emotion you would measure would be pain.

Another of their potential designs uses the idea of <a href="http://excitedstate.wordpress.com/2008/09/13/assume-a-spherical-physicist/trackback/">spherical cows</a> (metaphor for approximations):

I especially love the insight that you can set the tail to zero here. It really simplifies things. :)
