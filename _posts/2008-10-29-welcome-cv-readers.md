So... I checked my blog this morning. Turns out I've got a CV spike;a huge spike in visitor stats thanks to a link on <em>Cosmic Variance</em>. This is my new record for daily visitors, and it's only the morning...

I thought I'd just say: Welcome! This is a relatively fresh blog I've brewed up ( I, being relatively new to blogging ). I try to post every few days and I tend to keep the posts science related in some way. If you want to know more about this blog, as usual, check the <a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/about/">about section</a> for words. If you want to get a feel for this blog, I'd recommend browsing over these past posts:
