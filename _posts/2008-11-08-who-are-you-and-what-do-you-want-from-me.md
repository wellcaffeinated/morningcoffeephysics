Hello all. Posting is slow again this week. I blame life. (Don't worry I have a good one in the works that I hope you'll like).

In the mean time, my readership seems to be steadily growing and I've been looking for an excuse to try out this new poll feature in wordpress. So I'd appreciate if you could answer this poll I've set up to help me get a better idea of who my readers are and what your background is in physics. You see, I have no idea if my explanations are addressing the right audience. If you feel like telling me more in the comments, I'd love to hear what your interests are in physics and maybe what you're hoping to see (or see more of) on <em>Morning Coffee Physics</em>.

Cheers!
