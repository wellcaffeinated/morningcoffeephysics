It is a schematic diagram of a Drinking Bird toy (with hat). I didn't make it. I just decided one day that I was curious about the physics of this timeless toy. Looking around on the Internet, I found many qualitative explanations for the Drinking Bird. I wanted something with more equations. Fortunately, I stumbled onto <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=AJPIAS000071000012001257000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes">the article, <em>"Experiments with the drinking bird"</em>, by J. Güémez et al</a>. Unfortunately, now I need a new Ph.D. thesis topic... Seriously though, it's a fun paper to read.

If you aren't familiar with the Drinking Bird, for shame! It is a toy that is remarkable in its simplicity. Given a glass of water in which to dip its beak, it will bob up and down with no batteries required! Surely a few dollars is a worthy price to pay for this perpetual entertainment machine.

<em>...hey, wait a minute. Perpetual motion machines don't exist!</em>, you say?

You're right. I'm just being provocative to keep you on your toes. It's just that many people hint (or worse, even blatantly assert) that this is a perpetual motion machine. They are, of course, wrong. If you ever observe some contraption that seems to exhibit perpetual motion (that is, without an energy source), you are <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">probably</span> certainly overlooking the source of energy.

If you haven't thought about it before, take a second now and try to make a rough deduction as to where the bird gets its energy (no googling!). To help you out, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTkx3cdO5rM">here's a video of a drinking bird</a>.

Ok, so you must have realized that the glass of water has something to do with it. But what's up with the colored liquid inside the bird? And why do they all wear the same kind of hat? Well, I'll just mention right now that, despite its inclusion in the "serious diagram", the hat has more to do with the bird's dignity and self-image than its functionality.

First, let me give you a rough sketch of what's going on, then I'll elaborate on a few specific phenomena. The colored liquid inside the bird is not water, it is <em>Methylene Chloride</em> (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>). The gas inside the bird is not air, it's (surprise!) Methylene Chloride vapor! The Methylene Chloride is called a volatile liquid. This means that it has a boiling point very close to room temperature. As a result, the Methylene Chloride inside the bird is in, what we call, thermal equilibrium resulting in a coexistence of its gas phase and its liquid phase. Next, you need to know that the bird's head is a glass bulb (like the bottom) but the head is covered in fabric that absorbs a bit of water.

So, to start the drinking process the bird's head must be covered in water. Once this happens, the water on the head begins to evaporate and cools the head a little bit. This decrease in temperature causes some of the Methylene Chloride vapor in the head to condense into a liquid and fill up the neck a little bit. Since the liquid phase takes up much less space than the vapor phase, there is less vapor in the head to fill up practically the same volume. This means that the pressure in the head will <em>decrease,</em> causing a difference in pressure between the head and the base of the bird<em>. </em><a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/2008/10/28/an-inverse-glass-of-water/trackback">As we saw in my earlier post</a>, a difference in pressure results in a net force from the higher pressure area to the lower pressure area. This means that the little bit of vapor in the base of the bird forces the liquid up the neck and into the head. This gives the bird a heavy head, and forces it to dip. Once it dips, the liquid moves out of the way, letting the warmer vapor in the bottom move to the top warming the head a bit and starting the cycle all over again.

Let's look a bit closer at the water evaporating from the head. For the readers who are less experienced with physics, you might not have really thought about the reason water evaporates even at room temperature. Shouldn't liquid water only turn into a gas at 100 degrees C (at standard pressure)? Well, water of course does become a gas at less than its boiling point (look at the steam from your coffee cup for evidence). To see why this is you need to remember that a liquid is really just a collection of molecules undergoing random collisions with each other. The molecules are going to have an overall average velocity that increases with the liquid's temperature, but overall, the molecules will have different velocities. Near the surface of the liquid (the liquid-air boundary), some of the molecules will have a high enough velocity to "escape" the liquid and, instead, mix with the air. The reverse is also true; some water molecules already in the air will have low enough velocities to "stick" to the liquid water. The reverse process, however, is much less likely if the concentration of water in the surrounding air is low enough. When the air is <em>saturated</em> with water then that means there is enough water in the air that the rate of evaporation and rate of condensation are equal. So the frequency of the Drinking Bird's sips will depend on the humidity of the surrounding air (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIjXg5fvvas">here's a video showing that</a>).

But I still haven't answered my original question; where does the bird get its energy? As you may have guessed, it gets it from the surrounding air. Even though higher energy water molecules are being lost to the atmosphere from the head, this creates a temperature difference which ultimately drives the motion. The base of the bird is continually being warmed by the air, so when the bird dips, the warm Methylene Chloride in the base carries the thermal energy originally absorbed from the surroundings to the head. That's what keeps it drinking.

What do you think would happen if instead of giving the bird a glass of water, you gave it a glass of alcohol? Would it be more, or less enthusiastic about drinking the alcohol? Why?
