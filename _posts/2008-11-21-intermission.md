This is a rather non-serious post. You can blame Clifford at <em>Asymptotia</em> for it. His <a href="http://asymptotia.com/2008/11/21/asymptotias-type/trackback">recent post</a> pointed to a site called <em><a href="http://www.typealyzer.com">typealyzer</a></em> that claims to measure your blog's "type". This type classification seems to be based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">Myers-Briggs type indication</a> tests. I thought I'd play along just for fun. Here are the results:

<em>The logical and analytical type. They are especially attuned to difficult creative and intellectual challenges and always look for something more complex to dig into. They are great at finding subtle connections between things and imagine far-reaching implications.</em>

<em> </em>

<em>They enjoy working with complex things using a lot of concepts and imaginative models of reality. Since they are not very good at seeing and understanding the needs of other people, they </em><strong><em>might come across as arrogant, impatient and insensitive</em></strong><em> to people that need some time to understand what they are talking about.</em>

Well, I'm satisfied with that... except for maybe the part about me possibly coming across as arrogant, impatient and insensitive. Oh well. It also gave me a picture of my brain. Apparently there is an abundance of logic, mathematics, imagination and symbols.

Right now my brain is filled with mathematics. I'm doing some of my first TA work; correcting around 300 midterms for a Special Relativity class. I'll let you know how that goes if I survive...

In the mean time, if you need something to read, I'd recommend checking out <a href="http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/fdtd-g.htm">this essay by Alfie Kohn</a> about how current grading schemes actually inhibit learning in our education system, and what can be done about it.
