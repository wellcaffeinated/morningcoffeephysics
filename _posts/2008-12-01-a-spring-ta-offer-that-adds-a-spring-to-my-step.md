Hopefully the regular readers of this blog have deduced that I am driven to invoke enthusiasm about physics (and science in general) in anyone I come into contact with. One factor motivating me is the fact that people generally have <a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/2008/09/22/its-not-just-about-access-its-about-accessibility/trackback/">misconceptions about science and scientists</a> that push them away from learning wonderful things about the world. Recently, I found a link to a subsite of <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/">SEED magazine</a> that overviews the <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/stateofscience/index.html">current state of science</a>. The site, among many other things, highlights this <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/stateofscience/sos_fundamental_publicperception_p1.html">public perception of science</a>.

I also happily discovered that one of my fleeting ideas involving mixing coffee and science has actually been well established for a while! Maybe you're like me and you like the idea of discussing interesting aspects of science in a coffee shop setting. If you are, and you haven't heard of <a href="http://www.sciencecafes.org/index.html">science cafés, behold</a>!
<blockquote><em>Science cafés are live events that involve a face-to-face conversation with a scientist about current science topics. They are open to everyone, and take place in casual settings like pubs and coffeehouses.</em><em>
</em>

<em>At a café you can… l</em><em>earn about the latest issues in science, </em><em>chat with a scientist in plain language, </em><em>meet new friends, </em><em>speak your mind and, </em><em>talk with your mouth full.</em></blockquote>
And to make things even better, there are even a <a href="http://www.cafescientifique.ca/">few in Canada</a>. One of which, based in Toronto, I hope to check out sometime in the near future. When I do, you'll hear about it.

Let me also remind you of my <a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/2008/11/17/my-issues-with-physics-education/trackback/">dissatisfaction with conventional teaching methods (in physics)</a>, which I think can potentially do more harm than good at the introductory level. After all this buildup I can now tell you what the title of this post has been alluding to and hopefully you will understand my excitement. I just attended the first TA meeting to prepare me for the new pilot physics lab course at the University of Toronto. The physics department has caught on to what physics education researchers have been saying for a while: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17conv.html?ex=1342324800&amp;en=fc32915c8e32e97f&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">conventional lectures add <em>little or nothing</em></a> to a student's conceptual understanding about basic physics concepts. One tested improvement on physics education is called <em>Peer Instruction</em> which takes advantage of the fact that students predominantly learn best by interacting with each other. The U of T physics department is applying this method to one of the introductory physics courses. The curriculum emphasizes a hands-on approach to learning. Students work in small groups on conceptual problems which force them to discover things for themselves. The TAs act as guides who pose leading questions rather than giving solutions away (which sounds right up my alley!).

Even the architecture of the rooms has been completely rethought (I'll post pictures when I have a chance). They are shiny new rooms with hexagonal workstations able to seat a group of students. The workstations are each equipped with desktop computers and conveniently placed electrical sockets (for laptops, lab apparatus, etc...). The walls adjacent to the workstations are covered with panes of translucent glass which, other than looking stylish, act as "whiteboards" on which to work. One of the professors described the motivation behind the architecture as follows:
<blockquote>If you walk into a fast-food joint, there is an obviously placed counter underneath billboards that show the menu items and combos. There is a cash register at one end and meal trays on the other. Upon seeing this configuration, it is obvious that a customer should walk up to the counter, place their order, pay, and then sit down and eat. By contrast, a fancy restaurant contains groups of tables and a cash register near the door. Again, the architecture communicates that in order to get food, one should sit down, wait for someone to take your order, then pay when you are ready to leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the same way, a lecture hall gives the following message to a student: sit down, the teacher will be the center of your attention, and don't talk to each other. These new rooms fight that message by encouraging the opposite: group work and peer instruction.</blockquote>
Apparently they've conducted a pilot program for this course. I asked about the effect it has had on the students' learning and overall impression of physics. The professor commented that the grades on the midterm have greatly improved from previous years. But what I find more exciting is his comment that he now sees students who, after being forced to leave the classroom, seek out unlocked classrooms to further discuss with each other what they've just learned! And <em>these aren't physics majors</em>. These are students from varied programs of study!

... and I get to be a Teaching Assistant...
or should that be <em>Learning Assistant</em> now...
