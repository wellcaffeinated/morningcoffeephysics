<em>... so what? Another year, another orbit of the earth. What's the big deal</em>, you say?

Well! I have some New Year's news for you. Firstly, did you know that this year <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2008/12/leaping_seconds.php">we get an extra second</a>? To deal with this I suggest counting like a computer scientist; <em>...3, 2, 1,<strong> 0</strong>! Happy New Year!</em>

This year will, apparently, be the <a href="http://www.astronomy2009.org/">International Year of Astronomy</a>! Georgia at<em> <a href="http://earthandskyscience.blogspot.com/">Earth &amp; Sky Science</a></em> has found a great way to celebrate: <a href="http://365daysofastronomy.org/">365 days of Astronomy Podcasts.</a>

If that's not enough, why not <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/more/lightcone/">follow your lightcone this year</a>? I found a great site that provides an RSS feed of astronomical bodies you (yes you!) could possibly have influenced since your birth.

<em>... what's a lightcone</em>, you ask?

A lightcone is the 4-D surface in space and time that a flash of light forms as it travels away from its origin. The name is actually a bit misleading. It's less of a cone, and more of a hyper-cone; that is a cone in four dimensions. Imagine a flash of light. As it moves forward in time the light will move outwards in all directions. At any point in time the light will be confined to the area of a sphere. As time progresses, the sphere will grow in size at a constant rate. If we think of time as another dimension, and tried to draw a 4-D graph of the flash, it would be a hyper-cone.

If you are still confused, a good way to begin thinking about this is to imagine a very small circle lying flat on the ground. Now, imagine it growing and as it grows you move it upwards. Every time the circle grows one centimeter in radius, it moves one centimeter higher up. This traces out the 3-D cone you know and love. The upward direction represents time and the other directions represent a 2-D space. To generalize to a 3-D space with time, you change the idea of a growing circle to a growing sphere. Et voila: a lightcone.

<em>... ok, so what's so special about a lightcone</em>, you ask?

Since a lightcone is the boundary on which a flash of light travels, and nothing can travel faster than light, the lightcone also marks the boundary of influence of a certain action. Let's say, for example, you sneezed. Achoo. At some other time, in some other place, let's say a book fell over. Could your sneeze have possibly caused the book to fall over? What you could do is mark two points on a graph; one representing the time and place of your sneeze and the other representing the time and place of the falling book. You could draw a lightcone originating at the sneeze point. If the other point is outside this lightcone then it is physically impossible for your sneeze to have caused the book to fall over.

You could also do the same for your birth. Draw a cone originating from earth at your birthday. Now draw points for all the stars in the sky at time: today. Any points inside your lightcone<em> could</em> have been influenced by your birth. The word "could" is in italics because it's really saying: "sure, the laws of special relativity don't disagree with you... but... there's more to cause and effect than lightcones". Still, it's a fun way to learn about astronomy!

So this year be aware of your lightcone and keep track of the people and events inside it. The range of influence of your actions is probably a lot more vast than you originally thought...
