I thought it was about time I gave you (yes you!) a physics riddle to go with your morning coffee. I'll state the problem first and then give a few hints below the fold. Readers with a familiarity with ideas in physics can probably solve this without any hints. If you are unfamiliar with physics, don't be ashamed to check out the hints. Most importantly: <em>this riddle can be solved without any equations</em>. Feel free to post your solutions in the comments. I'll give the solution as a comment later on.

Okay. Here it is:

[caption id="attachment_368" align="aligncenter" width="450" caption="Not to scale..."]<a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/hinge-and-rope.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-368  " title="Hinge and Rope" src="http://morningcoffeephysics.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/hinge-and-rope.png" alt="Not to scale..." width="450" height="106" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align:left;">You have two objects:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A rope of length a given length.</li>
	<li>Two pieces of (let's say...) wood joined by a bolt. Together these pieces of wood stretch out to be the same length as the rope.</li>
</ul>
These objects are the same length, same mass and the same mass per unit length. You now hang them by their endpoints so that they hang side by side (as shown in the picture). The horizontal distance between the endpoints on which they hang is the same for the wood pieces as it is for the rope.

Which object has the lower center of mass?

<strong>Note</strong>: If you are unfamiliar with the concept of center of mass, check out <a href="http://blog.dotphys.net/2008/12/the-physics-of-baby-carriers/trackback/">Rhett's post on DotPhysics here</a>. You don't need to understand it all for the purposes of this problem, just know what center of mass is.

<!--more-->Now, some hints:

1) Think about what a lower center of mass means in terms of the potential energy. If an object has a lower center of mass, then it has less potential energy.

...

...

...

2) Objects tend to like to lower their energy any way they can. If an object has a certain amount of energy and is able to shift its configuration in a way that immediately lowers its energy, then it will do so.

Good luck!
