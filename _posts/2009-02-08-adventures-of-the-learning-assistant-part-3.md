Sorry for the silence this week... you know how it is.[/pullquote]

Before I begin, looks like the MIT physics department is having <a href="http://physicsworld.com/blog/2009/01/is_interactive_physics_the_way.html">a few troubles of its own with the new physics curriculum</a>. And, don't forget to check out the <a href="http://excitedstate.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/teaching-journal-week-2/trackback">First Excited State for Week 2</a> of the teaching journal.

I need <strong>your</strong> help. The practicals are becoming slightly tricky in terms of grabbing students' attention for tutorial-like situation. As I mentioned last week, the students are vastly more motivated to do the activities than ask tutorial questions because they will be getting graded on the activities. We have the ability to create quiz questions on their workstation computers and we've tried creating a quiz question to try to draw out questions from the students. What actually happened was they spent a little while on the question, guessed if necessary (since it wasn't worth any grades) and then didn't ask any questions (probably for fear of not having enough time to do the lab activity).

I've been toying with a few ideas to try to get their participation in asking questions. The first is instead of asking the whole class a question and going over the solution, to instead go around and ask each workstation one at a time. It would take up the same amount of time for the students. The upside is that they will be much less shy and almost certainly reveal any gaps they have in their understanding. The downside is that any enlightening bit of information will be confined to that table.

In order for the whole class to benefit, I'd have to somehow engage the whole class in problem solving. One general idea I've had in that respect is to do away with a multiple choice quiz type question (and eliminate half hazard guesses) and instead ask an involved/conceptual problem. They could then write their answers/ideas on their whiteboards and share their ideas with the rest of the class. Alternately, if they are too shy to speak up, I could go around the class while they are working on the activities and look at the ideas on their whiteboards and discuss with them.

I think the problem here is shyness and time constraints. I'm wondering if any of you have ideas to get students to participate in sharing their conceptual difficulties with the class. Also, I'm wondering if any of you have any ideas for relatively short, interesting questions on the subject of static electricity.
