<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Two_red_dice_01.svg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-395" title="Quantum Dice" src="http://morningcoffeephysics.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/two_red_dice_01.png?w=128" alt="Quantum Dice" width="128" height="82" /></a>Quantum mechanics is weird. It gets even weirder when you try to interpret what the theory is telling you about "reality". In fact, I'm taking a course at the moment called: <em>Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics</em>. I'm hoping eventually I'll get some blogable material out of it.

For now, I have a question for you all. It will be a purely subjective question (not like <a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/physics-riddle-of-rope-and-wood/trackback">last time</a>). I've blogged about the <a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/2007/05/25/quantum-entanglement/trackback">random nature of the quantum world</a> before, and I've also given an account of <a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/2008/02/26/can-you-fool-a-photon/trackback">an experiment</a> that demonstrated the requirement (under certain assumptions) for an inherently random world, but the nature of reality is still a hotly debated topic in the world of physics. Some physicists reject the notion of a world that is fundamentally random and instead consider the possibility that we're not seeing the whole picture. They come up with, so called, hidden variable theories that attempt to explain away the randomness by postulating some hidden property in the small world that we can't directly measure. I've also recently <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3907">come across a paper</a> that hypothesises that the (random) quantum mechanical nature of the very very small could be an emergent phenomenon; that is to say (in pedestrian terms) we aren't squinting hard enough to see all of the information about a quantum system and this lack of information results in seemingly random behaviour.

I wish I understood these things well enough to explain them here... but I don't. Instead I'd like to know what your personal preference is for reality and why.

Which description of reality are you (secretly?) cheering for? Are you more comfortable with the completely non-random deterministic view of the world, or are you instead enjoying the idea of a world built on random behaviour? <em>AND WHY?</em>
