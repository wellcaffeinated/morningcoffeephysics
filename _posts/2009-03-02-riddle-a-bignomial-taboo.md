Okay. So, I have another riddle for you. This one is not really physics based, but still it can be solved with logic alone (no math). I'll give it to you in storybook form just for fun.

<em>Once upon a time there was a forest, and in this forest there lived a sufficiently large number of gnomes (the exact number of gnomes doesn't matter). They were <strong>extremely logical beings</strong> and valued the needs of the group far above their own individual needs, so much so that no mirrors existed in their village, so as to keep the focus of their attention away from themselves. They valued homogeneity, which was just as well since all of them were identical... well, except for one thing: their hats. For some inexplicable reason, while most of the gnomes had red hats, there were a certain number of them (<strong>say "N"</strong>) who had blue hats. These blue hatted gnomes didn't themselves know that they had blue hats (for lack of mirrors, you see) and it was a taboo subject of the highest degree. No gnome would EVER give any indication -- <strong>verbal or otherwise</strong> -- as to the color of another gnome's hat. </em>

<em>One day, at one of the gnome village meetings, where <strong>all</strong> the gnomes gathered to discuss serious matters, they decided as a group that because they valued homogeneity so much, it would be better for the village if all of the blue hatted gnomes left and lived elsewhere. Nothing more was discussed. No gnomes were singled out as having blue hats. The blue hatted gnomes were simply expected to leave as soon as they knew they had blue hats.</em>

<em>How many village meetings passed before all of the blue hatted gnomes left?</em>

This is a really tricky riddle.Â Just remember, the solution has nothing to do with the gnomes using sign language to tell other gnomes about their hats, or using spoons as mirrors to see themselves. It's a much more elegant and logical solution. If you haven't heard it before, feel free to bounce ideas back and forth in the comments.
