Maybe you aren't really sure how those crazy physicists come up with all of these equations and theories seemingly from thin air. Maybe you're getting a bit bored of F=ma posts. Well, I'm going to try my best to give you a bit of an inside look at some of the conceptual tools commonly used by physicists in a little series called: The Physicist's Toolbox.</em>

<strong>This week: Thought Experiments</strong>

<strong><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:P_psychology.png"><img class="alignleft" title="Thinking man" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/P_psychology.png" alt="" width="100" height="98" /></a></strong>When someone mentions the term "thought experiment", the first person that probably comes to mind is Einstein and his daydream about trying to chase a beam of light -- an image of which even non-physicists will be familiar. This is because thought experiments tend to be very memorable and accessible because they usually involve simple math or no math at all. Despite their mathematical simplicity, however, they still manage to shed light on puzzling aspects of nature.

Physics is an empirical science which means that you can do all the thinking and theorising you want, but at the end of the day, if it doesn't match the real world experimental results, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b240PGCMwV0">it's wrong</a>. This fact might make the term "thought experiment" seem like a bit of an oxymoron. It's true, a thought experiment won't serve to prove anything in the same way a real experiment would, but it still has tremendous value. Thought experiments serve to collect one's thoughts and attempt to make certain concepts in physics more intuitive. Occasionally they can shed new light on how the world works.

Here's a really neat example. Remember Galileo? Remember the story of him dropping a cannon ball and a musket ball from the leaning tower to show that they fell at the same rate? Well, it's unlikely that Galileo actually did this. It's more likely that this was a well crafted thought experiment. Imagine starting with the assumption that heavier objects fall faster. What happens now if you attach a lighter object to a heavy object? The light object would want to fall slower than the heavy one, and would almost act like a parachute for the heavy one. But if you consider the compound object, it is heavier than both objects alone. So shouldn't it fall faster? This thought experiment demonstrates that the assumption that heavier objects fall faster leads to a contradiction. An obvious resolution to the contradiction is to declare that all objects, regardless of their weight, fall at the same rate. If one did this experiment in real life would probably not see the objects fall at the same rate because of air friction. The power of the thought experiment is in its simplicity. It serves to demonstrate how nature should behave under certain assumptions and signals that something more is needed to be understood if nature doesn't behave like this.

Really, just the simple picture of a few trajectories of a cannon ball being shot with greater and greater force demonstrates how things like the moon can orbit the earth. Good thought experiments like this tend to give the thinker an "aha!" moment; that moment of realization.

I've blogged about a few thought experiments here on <em>Morning Coffee Physics</em>. Some fun ones include <a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/2007/04/23/space-and-time-are-curved/trackback/">Einstein's elevator experiment</a>, and the <a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/physics-riddle-of-rope-and-wood/trackback">Rope and Wood riddle</a>.

<a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/triangle-chain-toponly.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-472" title="Traingular Block Chain Thought Experiment" src="http://morningcoffeephysics.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/triangle-chain-toponly.jpg" alt="Traingular Block Chain Thought Experiment" width="220" height="151" /></a>There's one more thought experiment I really like. Imagine placing a chain (constant mass per unit length) on an obtuse triangular block. On one side, there is less chain, but a steeper slope. On the other side, there is more of the chain, but the slope is not too steep. Which way will the chain slide?

Sure, you could work out the forces and angles and all that jazz. But there is a very simple way to see the answer. Think about it for a few seconds.

...

Done? Okay.

<a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/triangle-chain.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-474" title="Triangular Block Chain Thought Experiment" src="http://morningcoffeephysics.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/triangle-chain.jpg" alt="Triangular Block Chain Thought Experiment" width="220" height="151" /></a>Just connect another chain below and let it hang off of the ends of the previous chain, like so. Have you felt that "aha!" moment yet?

The hanging chain is symmetric so it should pull on each side of the top chain equally, which cancels its effect out. But if the top chain slid to one side or the other, for every link that fell off the block, another would replace it on the other side (coming from the hanging chain). Meaning the two (now linked) chains would spontaneously spin around the block! This is a ridiculous notion and a violation of the laws of conservation of energy. Therefore, the chain in the previous picture must remain at rest. No math necessary!

Anyone else have a favorite thought experiment?
