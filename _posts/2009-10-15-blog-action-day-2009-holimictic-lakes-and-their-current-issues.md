So, in case you don't know by now, it's <a href="http://blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day 2009</a>... ( or at least, it will be for another half hour. I'm a bit behind the times.)
<blockquote><em>Blog Action Day is an annual event held every October 15 that unites the world’s bloggers in posting about the  same issue on the same day with the aim of sparking discussion around an issue of global importance. Blog Action Day 2009 will be one of the largest-ever social change events on the web.</em></blockquote>

Yes, that scary thing.

I puzzled a while trying to think of something physicsy to tell you about climate change. I could tell you that same story about how CO2 in the atmosphere traps heat causing an increase in average global temperatures. I could tell you that this is exactly the reason why the planet Venus (with a CO2 rich atmosphere), although it is further than the sun from Mercury, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus#Atmosphere_and_climate">is hotter by a long shot</a>. But I decided against repeating those same old stories, because I figure you've probably heard them many times and are probably getting numb. Instead I'm going to go outside my comfort zone and plunge into the depths of Limnology and tell you about some current issues involving climate change in the convective currents of holimictic lakes.

<em>...what's a holimictic lake</em>, you ask?

Good question. I'm not much for fancy names; I prefer concepts. So, let's start with the basics. Firstly, you must have heard that hot air rises. But why does it do that? Well, air that is hotter than the air surrounding it is also less dense than that air. This means that a volume of hot air weighs less than the same volume of colder air. The colder air will be pulled towards the earth more than hot air and so hotter air will be pushed out of the way (upwards) by colder air.

The same is true for water, but only to a certain degree; 4°C to be exact. Water, unlike air, is densest at 4°C, so in a tub of 5°C water, a 7°C blob of water will tend to rise to the top. On the other hand, in a tub of 1°C water, a 3°C blob of water will tend to <em>sink</em> because even though it's warmer it is more dense.

Now, consider a lake in the four seasons. During the Summer the lake water is generally above 4°C, so the sun will warm the top layers of the lake and that water (being warmer and less dense) will stay on top and the cooler water will stay deeper down.

When Fall comes around the top part of the lake will be cooled. Eventually that top part of the lake will cool to the same temperature as the bottom part. Winds can cause some turbulence and the bottom parts and top parts of the lake will get mixed up.

When Winter comes along the top part of the lake will be colder than the bottom part which can happen when the lake is lower than 4°C. The top layer of the lake may freeze over and the lake will again get separated into layers of different temperature -- this is called <em>stratification</em>.
<p style="text-align: center;">The lake gets mixed up again when Spring comes around. The top of the lake will be heated again and when the lake water at the top reaches 4°C it will sink to the bottom and mix up the lake.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LSE_Stratification.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-492 aligncenter" title="Stratification" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/LSE_Stratification.png/800px-LSE_Stratification.png" alt="Stratification" width="550" height="183" /></a>A lake that undergoes this kind of mixing is called a <em>holimictic lake</em> and if it does it twice a year (as described above) it's called a <em>dimictic lake</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>...what does this have to do with climate change</em>, you ask?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, nutrients from the lakebed seep into the lower parts of the lake while it's stratified (Summer and Winter for a dimictic lake). When the lake mixes, these nutrients get mixed into the whole lake. If you are aquatic life which has adapted to depend on those nutrients, this mixing is a very good thing. Without it, many species of fish would not be able to survive in that lake.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Climate change threatens to put a damper on that mixing process for some lakes. As average global temperatures increase, unusually warm Winters become more likely. What would happen to a dimictic lake during one of these unusually warm Winters? Well, the lake won't cool very much during the Fall, and might even stay above that 4°C mark. This would cause less mixing during the Fall. To make matters worse, because of the warm Winter, there will be less mixing during the Spring as well. To make matters worse still, those salts that are dissolved in the deep parts of the lake make those deep layers more dense. Less mixing during a certain Fall or Spring means more salts stay built up in the deep layers of the lake making it <em>even more</em> difficult to mix the upper and lower layers in future seasons. This is a runaway process and it can lead to a nutrient deficient lake, and very unhappy fish.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The take away message? Climate change isn't just about things getting warmer and sweating more during the summer. Climate change is a direct threat to whole ecosystems. By tipping ecosystems out of balance it endangers many species of animals, including the animals causing the tipping (us). It's high time that <em>you</em> start sweating over this situation. Please think about ways to cut your greenhouse gas emissions. If you need some suggestions, <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/10/if-we-all-just-do-two-things-we-can-prevent-climate-change.php">here are two good ones</a>.</p>
