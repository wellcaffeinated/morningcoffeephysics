A<a href="http://morningcoffeephysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mcpavatar.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-676" title="Morning Coffee Physics Avatar" src="http://morningcoffeephysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mcpavatar.jpg" alt="" width="122" height="123" /></a> poet once said:

<em>the whole universe is in a glass of wine.</em>

I think <strong>wine</strong> can easily be replaced by <strong>coffee</strong>, don't you?

<em>Morning Coffee Physics</em> is my way of trying to share what I see some mornings when I look at the steaming hot cup of coffee in front of me. There are things about the world you can't see with your eyes.

But we can <strong>measure</strong> them. We can <em>infer</em> them. And we can be sure of them.

These sometimes unseeable things are discovered by the process of science. And Â scientific knowledge goes beyond mere technological application. This knowledge lets you see the invisible things about the world with your mind.

Sometimes after discovering these things you may ask yourself, "<em>why didn't anyone tell me this before?</em>" I know I did. I sometimes became giddy from this new knowledge. I wanted to share it with the world. I want you to see what I see when I look at a cup of coffee.

The great physicist, Richard Feynman, put it very eloquently...
<blockquote><em>A poet once said, "The whole universe is in a glass of wine."  We will
probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to
be understood.  But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely
enough we see the entire universe.  There are the things of physics: the
twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the
reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms.  The glass is
a distillation of the earth's rocks, and in its composition we see the
secrets of the universe's age, and the evolution of stars.  What strange
array of chemicals are in the wine?  How did they come to be?  There are the
ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products.  There in wine is
found the great generalization: all life is fermentation.  Nobody can
discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the
cause of much disease.  How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into
the consciousness that watches it!  If our small minds, for some
convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts --
physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on -- remember that
nature does not know it!  So let us put it all back together, not forgetting
ultimately what it is for.  Let it give us one more final pleasure: drink it
and forget it all!</em>

Have fun, explore, you'll hear from me again very soon.
