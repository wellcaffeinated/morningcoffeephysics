<img class="alignleft" title="Carnival" src="http://www.soham.org.uk/images/carnival.gif" alt="" width="89" height="92" />Come one, come all to the <em>thirty first edition</em> of <a href="http://ontheshouldersofgiants.wordpress.com/">The Giant's Shoulders Blog Carnival</a>! A monthly event of epic scientific proportions. Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Don't be shy. Our featured carnies will give you a glimpse into the history of science by presenting classic scientific literature and providing helpful context for the casual reader. Come one, come all. A fantastic spectacle awaits...

Speaking of spectacles, put on yours, and look through the lens of time with these two optics articles...

<a href="http://electron9.phys.utk.edu/phys135d/modules/m10/images/prism.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-679" title="prism" src="http://morningcoffeephysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/prism.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="179" /></a>First up is <strong>Kirsten Walsh</strong>, who sheds some light on Newton's first optical paper in her post: <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2011/01/newtons-crucial-experiment/">Newton’s ‘Crucial Experiment’ – Early Modern Experimental Philosophy</a> from the blog <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/">Early Modern Experimental Philosophy</a>.

Now, if there's one blogger that knows how to tell a story, it's <strong>Jennifer Ouellette. </strong>She has reimagined the story of Ibn al-Haytham, who some consider to be the father of modern optics. <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/indepth/44677">The Scholar and the Caliph</a> is posted at <a href="http://physicsworld.com/">physicsworld.com</a>.

For some more <em>light</em> reading, we have two articles pertaining to the hotspot of light itself; the sun...

<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sunflare_skylab4_big.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-680" title="Sunflare_skylab4_big" src="http://morningcoffeephysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sunflare_skylab4_big.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="192" /></a>Christie Thony</strong> has spotted the spotty history of the discovery of sun spots. If you have a spot of curiosity, <a href="http://thonyc.wordpress.com">The Rennaissance Mathematicus</a> is the spot for you, check out the article: <a href="http://thonyc.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/spotting-the-spots/">Spotting the Spots</a>.

<strong>﻿﻿Dr. SkyScull</strong> writes an illuminating article on the discovery of the connection between radioactivity and solar radiation: <a href="http://skullsinthestars.com/2010/12/21/the-first-glimmer-of-a-nuclear-sun-radium-and-solar-energy-1903/">The first glimmer of a nuclear Sun: radium and solar energy (1903)</a> posted at <a href="http://skullsinthestars.com">Skulls in the Stars</a>.

If the last two articles have left you with a bit of heat stroke, plunge into the ice-cold subject of glacier research with <strong>David Bressan.</strong> Here David will tell you the chilling story of how Glacier research came to be. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=the-discovery-of-the-ruins-of-ice-t-2011-01-03">Guest Blog: The discovery of the ruins of ice: The birth of Glacier research</a> is posted at <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog">Scientific American</a>.

Cold not your style? You prefer something with a bit more energy? Behold, <strong>Stephen</strong> at <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry">Reciprocal Space</a> has written an energetic post about the man behind the SI unit: Joule in an article titled: <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2011/01/03/joules-jewel/">Joule's Jewel</a>.

<img class="alignright" title="Carbon" src="http://asymptotia.com/wp-images/2007/05/carbon400.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="177" />Speaking of hot things... <strong>Alun</strong> tells us the secret to a good date... a carbon date, that is. Check it out: <a href="http://alunsalt.com/2011/01/05/archaeologists-prove-the-secret-to-a-successful-date-is-knowing-what-is-on-the-menu/">Archaeologists prove the secret to a successful date is knowing what is on the menu</a> posted at <a href="http://alunsalt.com">AlunSalt: Ancient Science and the Science of Ancient Things</a>.

Expect the unexpected at a blog carnival, ladies and gentlemen... and in science also...

<strong>Michal Meyer </strong>takes a step back, and gives us a window into the nature of scientific discovery and the detours it sometimes takes. <a href="http://www.chemheritage.org/community/periodic-tabloid/2011-01-11-discovery.aspx">Discovery</a> is posted at <a href="http://www.chemheritage.org/community/periodic-tabloid/">Periodic Tabloid</a>.

Fun for the entire family! Something for the children, perhaps? <strong>Alice </strong>takes a look at early records of scientific literature for children in <a href="http://alicerosebell.wordpress.com/2010/12/23/a-bit-of-victoriana/">A bit of Victoriana</a> posted at <a href="http://alicerosebell.wordpress.com">through the looking glass</a>.

<strong>William Eamon</strong> presents an iconic time in the development of science in <a href="http://www.williameamon.com/?p=453">The Iconography of Scientific Discovery in the Renaissance (Part I)</a> posted at <a href="http://www.williameamon.com">The Official Website of Author William Eamon</a>.

A separate but equal introduction is deserved by <strong>Romeo Vitelli</strong> who recounts the academic life of Mamie Phipps who's scientific research transformed her into a civil rights icon. <a href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2010/12/separate-but-equal.html">The "Separate But Equal" War</a> is posted at <a href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/">Providentia</a>.

Stand back, ladies and gentlemen! The next topic is not for the faint of heart, for it has been known to send some into the depths of utter madness...

<strong>Alexi Baker </strong>talks about the darker side of longitude in <a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/blogs/longitude/2010/12/longitude-and-lunacy.html#000980">Longitude and Lunacy</a> posted at <a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/blogs/longitude/">Board of Longitude</a>.

Creepy crawlies and things that go bump in the night...

What would a carnival be without a <em>freak show</em>? <strong>David Bressan</strong> digs down into past literature and unearths some interesting specimens in <a href="http://historyofgeology.blogspot.com/2010/12/greatest-show-on-earth.html">The greatest show on Earth</a> posted at <a href="http://historyofgeology.blogspot.com/">History of geology</a>.

We laughed, we cried, we were left bug-eyed, and now it's time to pack up and move on. No place is home for a carnival, but the Giant's Shoulders still needs a place to stay next month. If you would like to host the next blog carnival, leave a comment on the <a href="http://ontheshouldersofgiants.wordpress.com/">Giant's Shoulders site</a>. Thank you guests, organizers and carnies.

It's time for <em>Morning Coffee Physics</em> to get back to its regular scheduled blogging, starting with another cup of coffee.
