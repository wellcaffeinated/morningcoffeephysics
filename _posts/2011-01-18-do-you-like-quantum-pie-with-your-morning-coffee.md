<img class="alignright" title="Quantum Pie" src="http://www.quantumpie.com/wp-content/themes/dynamik/css/images/pie-footer-web.png" alt="" width="194" height="194" />New Blog Alert!

Exciting news for those of you who like quirky physics blogs. One of my good friends, a Ph.D. in physics and fellow swing dancer, has started a delicious new blog called <strong>Quantum Pie</strong>. Find it at: <a href="http://quantumpie.com">quantumpie.com</a>.

He's lined up a series of great posts focusing on the magic of quantum mechanics. He's honing his video making skills and is producing some great videos like <a href="http://www.quantumpie.com/what-is-quantum-entanglement/">this one</a>. We'll be cross-posting eventually and we have tentative plans to do a video series together that uses dance to help explain physics (or at least to catch attention). The series will be called <em>Two to Tangle</em> (pun on quantum entanglement). The first of our swing dance video series starts with his <em>Dance your Ph.D</em> submission which he choreographed, but also starring yours truely.

Most of you probably don't know that I'm a swing dancer, so here's proof. Sit down, relax, have some pie and a coffee and enjoy some physicists try to explain a PhD with a dance called the Lindy Hop.
