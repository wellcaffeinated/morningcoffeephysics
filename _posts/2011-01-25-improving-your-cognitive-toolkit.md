[pullquote]people find strangers more likable when they form their first impressions while holding a cup of warm coffee...[/pullquote]

I always love talking to new people about what they do. Not only because it makes for interesting conversation, but also because I like to hoard skills. I love the nitty-gritty. I love general concepts. And usually, different people with different backgrounds have some very interesting bits of knowledge.

This is why I found <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_index.html">this link so interesting</a> (scroll down quite a bit). It is a list of 164 responses to a specific question:
<blockquote>What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?</blockquote>
It's essentially a collection of ideas, concepts, and "did you know?"s that a large assortment of "big thinkers" find interesting or useful.

For me: gold.

I haven't finished browsing through all of the contributions, but two have caught my eye so far.

The first is <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_9.html#alter">Adam Alter's tour</a> through the subconscious influences seemingly mundane things have on our thoughts, feelings and opinions.
<blockquote><em>[...] while we're focusing on the business of daily life, our brains are processing multitudes of information below the surface of conscious awareness. Meanwhile, this peripheral information subtly shapes our thoughts, feelings and actions, and crafts some of our most critical life outcomes. <em>[...] </em></em>

<em>[...] recent studies have shown that people find strangers more likable when they form their first impressions while holding a cup of warm coffee.</em>

<em>[...] people think more creatively when they're exposed to the Apple Computers logo, or when they witness the illumination of an incandescent light bulb [...]</em></blockquote>
The second is a similar self-deception described by <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_9.html#sapolsky">Robert Sapolsky</a>. One that is best dealt with by adopting a scientific mindset. This is the idea that people tend to bias their opinions towards anecdotal evidence (stories) rather than objective data (ex: statistics).
<blockquote><em>[...] Every good journalist knows its power — start an article with statistics about foreclosure rates or feature a family victimized by some bank? No brainer. [...]</em>

<em>[...] But anecdotalism is potentially a domain of distortion as well. Absorb the lessons of science and cut saturated fats from your diet, or cite the uncle of the spouse of a friend who eats nothing but pork rinds and is still pumping iron at age 110? Depend on one of the foundations of the 20th century's extension of life span and vaccinate your child, or obsess over a National Enquirer-esque horror story of one vaccination disaster and don't immunize? [...]</em></blockquote>
A good story is a powerful thing and is probably much more intuitive to people than scientific data. But a general understanding of science -- what it is, how it's done and why you can trust it -- is also a powerful thing and it's a great tool for gaining perspective. The problem is the latter takes time to acquire.
