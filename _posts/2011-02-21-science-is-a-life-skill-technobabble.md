People like me keep telling others to be skeptical and think critically about factual claims overheard on the internet, mass media and even from friends and relatives. And I actually think people are starting to catch on. Probably thanks to the number of "not quite true" advertisement messages people get exposed to on a daily basis. But how can one actually be skeptical about important factual claims when even rigorous scientific results are so dizzyingly incomprehensible? How can you tell the difference? How can you be confident in your perception of the facts? Sometimes -- at least to me -- it feels like you'd need a Ph.D. in several fields of science to satisfy your skepticism of all the claims flying around!

Let's start on a light note, with a video...

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8u6BZv6_DLc"></iframe>

This is a video put together by one of my favorite scientific youtubers. Although I'm unsure of his name, he calles his youtube channel <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/C0nc0rdance">C0nc0rdance</a></em>.

While to most people -- especially those with a scientific background -- this video may be painfully funny, I hope that at least some detect a rather frightening element illustrated in this video. Let me elaborate...

As a scientist (and especially as a physicist), when I look at this video, I understand most of the words that fall out of these people's mouths -- yes, even in the Star Trek scenes. And to me, the sentences sound no more sensical than: "Pork pie scissors affect the banana glands which embigens the healing power of homeopathy". Having a knowledge of the meaning of these words allows me to easily differentiate between <strong>technobabble</strong> and <em>a logical explanation</em>. I'm sure those of you who have a certain knowledge of scientific terms also sympathize with that position.

But let's imagine that I hadn't done a degree in physics. Imagine I hadn't kept up to date with current discoveries in science. <em>How would I be able to tell what was science, and what was non-science (or nonsense)? </em>

I doubt many of my readers find it difficult to pin the tail to the crackpot claims in that video... but perhaps there are some. To those of you I say, don't be too hard on yourself. Sometimes, crackpot claims are much more subtle and harder to spot.

Let's continue with a harder example...

Consider the following two abstracts. The first was accepted in the APS Physics Journal (1990), and the second was accepted in the World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics (2005).
<blockquote>The Chern-Simons Lagrangian has been studied previously in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, where it is both gauge and Lorentz invariant. In 3+1 dimensions, this term couples the dual electromagnetic tensor to an external four-vector. If we take this four-vector to be fixed, the term is gauge invariant but not Lorentz invariant. In this paper, we examine both the theoretical consequences of such a modification and observational limits we can put on its magnitude. The Chern-Simons term would rotate the plane of polarization of radiation from distant galaxies, an effect which is not observed. From the observations we deduce that the magnitude of the vector is &lt;1.7×10-42h0 GeV, where h0 is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km sec-1 Mpc-1.</blockquote>
And...
<blockquote>Many physicists would agree that, had it not been for congestion control, the evaluation of web browsers might never have occurred. In fact, few hackers worldwide would disagree with the essential uniﬁcation of voice-over-IP and publicprivate key pair. In order to solve this riddle, we conﬁrm that SMPs can be made stochastic, cacheable, and interposable.</blockquote>
What if I were to tell you that one of these articles is serious research and one was, in fact, randomly generated technobabble? Can you tell which is which?

The first abstract is from a <a href="http://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v41/i4/p1231_1">physics article</a> written by distinguished theoretical physicist and blogger, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/sean/">Sean Carroll</a>. This is definitely serious scientific research. The second abstract is randomly generated. Seriously. It fooled some people well enough to get <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4449651.stm">accepted into the WMSCI in 2005</a>. You can read the <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/rooter.pdf">full article here</a>, and even make <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen">your own randomly generated technobabble article here</a>.

At a certain point, the difference between technobabble and respectable science becomes difficult to tell apart. Some ridiculous claims, in the right context, can become temptingly believable. On the other side of the coin, even claims from distinguished scientists are sometimes encoded in scientific lingo so much that even scientists in the same field find them difficult to understand.

<em>...it's impossible to know everything</em>, you say? (Well... not you, of course ;)) <em>It's futile to try to dissect all of the things people say out there. I'm going to let the scientists do their thing and I'll do mine. It's not like it's going to affect my life.</em>

I hear you. For a while, I was discouraged by that thought and there may be truth in it to a certain extent. <strong>But, a defeatist approach to scientific knowledge won't help you.</strong> And, the reality of the situation is probably closer to this:

<em>Even a small awareness of scientific facts and methods will present you with a huge advantage when it comes to siphoning out false claims and crackpots from the jumble information we juggle with on a daily basis.</em>

If you think that a knowledge of science is separate from "real life", I would invite you to consider this. <a href="http://conservapedia.com/Main_Page">Exhibit A: Conservapedia</a>. A wealth of completely false claims. Many of these claims, although rooted in false scientific claims, permeate into the political arena. As people who live in a democratic society, it matters what we deduce to be fact or fiction.

But what's to say that wikipedia is any more accurate? This is where science comes in. Not only is science a collection of knowledge, it's also a <strong>process</strong>. A way to filter out fact from fiction.

Science is a life skill. Like cooking, or cooperating with others, or reading a map. It's not just a profession, it's not just for nerds, it's not just a divider (but it can be). <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2008/09/science-is-worldview.html">Science is a world view</a>... a useful one that cuts through a lot of harmful and misleading bull. It doesn't just affect scientists, it affects our society, politics, our health ...

I think I'm going to make this a bit of a series. In future posts we'll look into what science really is, confirmation bias, and other neat things.
