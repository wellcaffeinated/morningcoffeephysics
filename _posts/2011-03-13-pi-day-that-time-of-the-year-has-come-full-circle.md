In honor of our favorite constant, I've prepared a little poem.

Ahem.

In many circles she's all the rage.
She's the greek character that we all adore,
whose irrational nature takes center stage.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:pi&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iVB9TayyApL3rAH1itXlBQ&amp;ved=0CBYQkAE">Defined by division</a>, as opposed to sum,
(<em>a fact that is known throughout the land</em>).
But don't count on her with your fingers and thumbs,
she flaunts more digits than you have on your hand.</p>
<img class="alignright" title="Pi Get Real" src="http://talklikeaphysicist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/pi-berational.jpg" alt="" width="155" height="154" />Men fight to reveal her decimal places,
-- <a href="http://gizmodo.com/#!5339831/pi-calculation-record-destroyed-25-trillion-decimals">around 2.5 trillion</a> is the current amount.
A complex attitude is not what she embraces,
but, she's a <em>real</em> number, and <strong>that's</strong> what counts.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I hesitate to sound slightly cliche,
but she's a hero unhonored and unsung.
And after all, it's true what they say:
two Pi is greater than one.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">yes...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><code class="eqn">\[ 2 \pi &gt; 1\]</code></p>
